Responsive website, built with Webpack, written with BEM syntax using Sass. Its part containing data, depending 
on the screen size, dynamically renders a table or a list of the above-mentioned data. The data from the object
array is automatically substituted into the automatically rendered table or list. This shows how to use the 
.machMedia () method instead of the older - .resize () method. Additionally, it includes the HTML <picture> 
tag instead of <img>, which allows you to indicate the use of an appropriate size photo depending on 
the screen size.
